# crop_recommendation_api
A machine learning api that recommends crop to farmers in other to increase farmers productivity

# Project Overview:

This project involves the development of a recommendation-based engine in collaboration with farmers to simulate a crop rotation system aimed at improving farm yield by 8%. The system will leverage data analytics, machine learning, and domain expertise to provide tailored recommendations to farmers, helping them optimize their crop rotation practices and enhance productivity. The initiative is a joint effort with Mungin Africa, a leader in agricultural innovation and support.

# Objectives:

Enhance Farm Productivity: Implement a crop rotation recommendation engine to improve farm yield by 8%.
Data-Driven Decisions: Utilize data analytics and machine learning to provide actionable insights and recommendations for farmers.
Sustainable Practices: Promote sustainable farming practices through optimized crop rotation systems.
Farmer Collaboration: Engage with farmers to ensure the solution meets their practical needs and incorporates their insights and feedback.
Key Components:

# Data Collection:

Gather historical crop yield data, soil health metrics, weather patterns, and other relevant agricultural data.
Collaborate with farmers to obtain first-hand data and insights.
Machine Learning Model:

# Develop a machine learning model to analyze the collected data and identify optimal crop rotation patterns.
Train the model using historical data to predict the impact of different crop rotations on yield.
Recommendation Engine:

# Build a recommendation engine that integrates with the machine learning model to provide personalized crop rotation suggestions for each farm.
Ensure the engine is user-friendly and accessible to farmers with varying levels of technical expertise.
Simulation and Testing:

# Simulate various crop rotation scenarios to evaluate their impact on farm yield.
Conduct field tests in collaboration with farmers to validate the modelâ€™s recommendations and make necessary adjustments.
